This smart contract built on solidity allows its users to deposit, borrow and lend tokens from the contract. The withdrawal option is available only to the ownner(deployer of the contract). 
ERC20 tokens have been used to manage the funds. 
Users can borrow upto 2 times thier deposited amount thereby showing PoS( Proof of Stake). 
The borrowers wil have to payback in tokens. Could have impleneted a function to collateralize the loan and reposses the collateral in case of defaulting the repayment from the borrrowers side.
Interest rates have not been implented and repayment amount is less than or equal to the borrowed amount i.e, payments in installments are allowed.
I apologize for any errors/warnings or informalities in the code.
